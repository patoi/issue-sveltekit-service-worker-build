# Service Worker build issue demo for SvelteKit

With `"@sveltejs/kit": "2.12.1",` the `service-worker/index.ts` file has been built and generated into `.svelte-kit/output/client/service-worker.mjs`

With `"@sveltejs/kit": "2.12.2",` the `service-worker/index.ts` file hasn't been built and missing from the app.
